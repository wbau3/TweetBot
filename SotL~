The opening sequence of The Silence of the Lambs holds a cherished place in my heart. Not in my movie-going heart, in my heart. The first time I saw the movie was unnotable, it was probably on my laptop, it was probably in my parent's living room, it was probably when I was 17. The second time I saw The Silence of the Lambs was the first time I watched The Silence of the Lambs. That was corny but now I've gotten that out of the way.

It was a tuesday night at 7:00 and the screening was for a film class and I can't remember which film class. I've never written a film review and I don't  intend to start now. This isn't about the plot or the characters this is entirely about me. This is about the impact of the experience of the movie on me. This is a selfish review. This isn't a review. 

<br /><br />

I haven't watched the movie since and I didn't refresh my memory before writing this because that isn't the point. The movie opens with a scene set in the forests of the east coast of the united states. I can remember the colors and feel of watching the print in the 3/4 scale theater where the screening took place. A young, serious woman is running a course in the woods. She is wearing a sweater adorned with 'FBI' across the chest. It's daytime and the credits are entering and exiting the screen. There is music playing. Is there music playing? There is in my memory.

Screenings were the only moments of peace in the first three years of college. We the students were prepped and prepared, lectured on the importance of the piece we were about to see. Told it's place in history, told the traits that put it on its pedestal. We were sent in with respect.

<br /><br />

That's what the opening sequence is to me. Seeing the beginning of the fulfillment of the expectations. The fullness of being told something is excellent and then seeing it to be excellent. Is the story so fulfilling? Is the journey of Clarice catching a murderer, the plot points carrying along a narrative, what created the feeling? It was in the moment. What hangs in my memory isn't the story. It never is. The plot and the images are there but that isn't where the weight is. I could forget the story and I could forget the characters and the feeling would remain.

No explanation of this movie to a friend would begin, "A young, serious woman is running a course in the woods."

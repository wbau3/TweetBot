#&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in sleepy Green Bay, Joe dreamt of action<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking to the stars, filled with dissatisfaction<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrounded by Jupiters he felt no larger than Mars<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Biking with the boys, struggling to reach handlebars<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;When he picked up a basketball they heckled and teased<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Embarrased and low, Joe went home so aggrieved<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at those legs, that reach and that height<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;No sympathy was found in the neighborhood those nights<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;He remained quite the dreamer, in spite of his femurs<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw puberty ahead, perhaps finally a redeemer<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls said ' It's fine ' Lord knows they didn't mind<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;They found him funny and kind, though to others he lagged behind<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence puberty began he grew slowly and gently<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he tried and tried, mind set on height so intently<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing to do, a scrub bush no tall pine<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the end of his days cursed to remain just 5'9"<br />
